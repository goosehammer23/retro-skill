# materialize-pr.sh — the repeatable halves of a promote materialization.
#
# A destination-shaped promote batch repeats the same sequence per proposal:
# fresh worktree off origin/main, (agent edits), signed commit, push, PR.
# Hand-typing it ~30x per campaign is where mistakes creep in (stale base,
# missed -S/--signoff, body heredoc quoting). This wraps the mechanical halves;
# the edits between `start` and `finish` stay with the agent.
#
# Usage:
#   materialize-pr.sh start  <repo-dir> <branch>
#       repo-dir: the project dir holding .bare (bare-worktree layout) or a
#       plain checkout. Fetches origin, creates a worktree named after the
#       branch (slashes become dashes) off origin/<default-branch> - inside
#       repo-dir for the bare layout, beside it for a plain checkout - and
#       prints the worktree path. The default branch falls back to main when
#       origin/HEAD is not set.
#   materialize-pr.sh finish <worktree-dir> <title> <body-file> <file>...
#       Refuses first when the first non-empty line under `## Came from` is
#       not the provenance line of the PR body template (patch-workflow.md) -
#       the line elsewhere, or an issue link to the repo, does not count - or
#       when a named evals.json adds or tightens an eval that carries no
#       `samples` (check-eval-samples.py). Then stages and commits
#       ONLY the named files (never -A; other staged changes stay out of the
#       commit), signed (-S --signoff, message = title), pushes -u, opens the PR for that branch (--head) with
#       --body-file, prints the PR URL.
#
# Exit: 0 ok; 2 unknown command, no file named, body file not found, body
# without the provenance line or an eval refused; 1 a missing positional
# argument; a failing git or gh command ends the script with that command's
# status. Never force-pushes, never merges.
